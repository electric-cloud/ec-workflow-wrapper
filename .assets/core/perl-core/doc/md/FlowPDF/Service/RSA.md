    Below are located Pure Perl dependencies for RSA signing.
     * Crypt::Perl::RSA with non-core dependecies
     * Math::BigInt (v1.999811).

     This Math::BigInt version should be included because some methods (e.g. bge() and bne() are not implemented in EC package)

     Modifications for original files:
      - Removed all library files from Crypt::Perl that was not required (simply deleted files one by one with a simple script)
      - Concatenated everything (except Bytes::Random::Secure::Tiny) to a single file
      - All 'use' are replaced with ->import() (because everything is located in a single file)
      - Added sign_RS1() signing method to Crypt::Perl::RSA::PrivateKey
      - Math::BigInt::Calc method api_version() was changed to _api_version() with corresponding places it was used
      - Patched Crypt::Format der2pem with string below to support keys passed without newlines
            $pem=~s<\s?-{5}(?:BEGIN|END)\s[A-Z\s]+-{5}\s?><>s;
      - Changed non-ASCII symbols (probably got there because of copying the code from browser's window)

     All concatenated modules was "packed" with
       $ perltidy -b -dp -dac --mangle dsl/properties/lib/EC/OAuthDependencies/RSA.pm
